# CPTS575_DataScience_Project
Multilabel Classification of Drug from Mechanism of Action (MoA).

Employed several FFNN architectures with hyperparameter tuning and multilabel stratified k-fold cross validation. Created model ensemble to further minimize the cross entropy loss. Acquired bronze medal in the associated Kaggle competition launched by LISH at Harvard (2020).
